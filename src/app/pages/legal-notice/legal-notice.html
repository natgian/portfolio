      <h2>SSL or TLS encryption</h2>
      <p>
        This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of
        confidential content, such as requests that you send to me as the site operator. You can
        recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes
        from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS
        encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
